Preparing to pay for college: Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). One of the tools you can use to estimate your eligibility for federal student financial assistance is the Financial Aid Estimator Tool – FAFSA4caster – which is available online at www.fafsa4caster.ed.gov.  You may have heard that if you have been convicted of a felony, you are not eligible to receive financial aid. This is not necessarily true. A student convicted for the possession or sale of illegal drugs may have eligibility suspended if the offense occurred while the student was receiving federal student aid (grants, loans, or work-study). When you complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), you will be asked whether you had a drug conviction for an offense that occurred while you were receiving federal student aid. If the answer is yes, you will be provided a special worksheet to help you determine whether your conviction affects your eligibility for federal student aid. You may preview the worksheet in the FAFSA Information section at www.studentaid.ed.gov/pubs. If you have been convicted of a forcible or nonforcible sexual offense, and you are subject to an involuntary civil commitment upon completion of a period of incarceration for that offense, you are ineligible to receive a Federal Pell Grant.

Asian American Recovery Services    
Our primary goal is to change an individual's substance-abusing lifestyle. This change comes about through four fundamental processes. First, individuals must acknowledge their problems, their own roles and responsibilities in abusing substances. Second, they must have the willingness to resolve and change their substance abusing behavior. Third, there needs to be an understanding and reconciliation of any conflict within themselves, their families and cultural traditions. Finally, they need to develop abilities and skills in managing their lives in the social, economic and political reality of their environment and community. The AARS-residential is a therapeutic community which recognizes the need for providing structure, support and opportunity within a multi-cultural environment. It is a highly structured environment with defined boundaries, both moral and ethical.

San Francisco Department of Child Support Services   
Compromise of Arrears Program (COAP) 
The Department's mission is to empower parents to provide for the economic and medical support needs of their children. COAP is a program for eligible noncustodial parents to reduce past-due child support (arrears) debt owed to the State.  This debt is owed because the State supported the family while the dependent children were on public assistance (welfare) or in foster care.  If you qualify for COAP you may offer to pay an amount that is less than the full amount you owe.  Any reduction in your arrears and interest owed will be based on your income and assets.  Arrears may be paid in a lump sum or in monthly installments over 36 months, depending on the individual circumstances.  www.sfgov.org/dcss or www.facebook.com/sfdcss

Services: For over 35 years this nonprofit public interest law firm has been in the forefront of legal efforts to enforce the Constitution and other laws inside the walls of California's prisons. With a small staff of attorneys and support personnel, the Prison Law Office represents individual prisoners, engages in class action and other impact litigation, educates the public about prison conditions, and provides technical assistance to attorneys throughout the country. (The office generally does not handle criminal appeals or habeas corpus petitions challenging criminal convictions.) 

California's prisons remain dangerously overcrowded at 147% of design capacity with over 122,000 prisoners crammed into 33 institutions, plus another 12,000 prisoners housed out-of-state and in community facilities. Basic necessities of life, such as medical and mental health care, are often lacking. Prisoners with disabilities are not recognized as disabled, and many are not provided reasonable accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Through both individual and impact litigation, the Prison Law Office has changed many California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation policies and practices, and has alleviated many of the cruel and unusual conditions that have been inflicted upon tens of thousands of state prisoners.

Delancey Street Foundation Los Angeles
Delancey Street is a residential education center for former substance abusers and ex-convicts. Its philosophy is that the people with the problems can teach themselves to become the solution. The program requires a minimum two-year commitment, and many individuals stay for longer. The Delancey Street Foundation Los Angeles facility is located near midtown, right off the Hollywood freeway. The facility, housing approximately 300 residents, was constructed as a 220 room hotel; the Mission style building complex includes a huge ballroom for catering events for up to 500 people, with smaller catering rooms as well. The buildings surround a large 8,000 square foot tropical garden with cascading waterfalls. Residents have completely renovated the building since we bought it in 1993. In order to make the hotel more of a home, residents turned the guest rooms into living units ranging from dorms for the newcomers into small apartments as residents earn their way to more spacious living quarters, and opened up the dining area to 6,000 square feet for resident meals. Delancey Street-Los Angeles also has a 50,000 square foot warehouse Business Complex located in Montebello. This complex houses a number of Delancey Training Schools including Moving & Trucking, Automotive, Auto Body Shop, Warehouse Shipping and Receiving, Terrarium, Ceramics and Iron Handcraft Works and Sales.  www.delanceystreetfoundation.org
