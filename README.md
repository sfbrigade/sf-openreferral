## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    % ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with [this script].

[this script]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop

After setting up, you can run the application using [foreman]:

    % foreman start

If you don't have `foreman`, see [Foreman's install instructions][foreman]. It
is [purposefully excluded from the project's `Gemfile`][exclude].

[foreman]: https://github.com/ddollar/foreman
[exclude]: https://github.com/ddollar/foreman/pull/437#issuecomment-41110407

Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to make sure it's running.

## Data Import

Data from the plaintext dump of APD's guidebook should be migrated into the
database as part of the `./bin/setup` script. The data import is handled by
Rails' `db/seeds.rb` file, and can be re-run with:

```
rake db:seed
```

If you ever need to reset the database, try:

```
rake db:drop db:setup db:seed
```
